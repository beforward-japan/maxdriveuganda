Modify the EXISTING React + Vite project now. Do NOT create a new plan. Apply the following updates end-to-end and run the app. If anything is ambiguous, make sensible defaults and proceed.

BRAND & ASSETS
- Primary brand color: ORANGE #F97316 (Tailwind “primary”).
- Use Inter font from Google.
- I’ve uploaded my logo. Ensure it’s available at /public/logo.png (rename/copy if needed) and used in the navbar.
- Remove ALL photos/stock images. Icons only.

TAILWIND (Play CDN, no toolchain changes)
- In index.html <head>, add Tailwind Play CDN + config:

  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  <script>
    tailwind.config = {
      theme: {
        extend: {
          colors: {
            background: "hsl(0, 0%, 100%)",
            foreground: "hsl(222.2, 84%, 4.9%)",
            muted: { DEFAULT: "hsl(210, 40%, 96.1%)", foreground: "hsl(215.4, 16.3%, 46.9%)" },
            primary: { DEFAULT: "#F97316", foreground: "#ffffff" },
            card: { DEFAULT: "#ffffff", foreground: "hsl(222.2,84%,4.9%)" }
          },
          borderRadius: { '2xl': '1rem' }
        }
      }
    }
  </script>
  (Also add Inter font <link> tags and set body to use Inter.)

INTERACTIONS & POLISH
- Use framer-motion for subtle fade/slide reveals on sections/cards.
- Smooth scrolling for navbar anchors.
- Focus-visible styles for accessibility; semantic <header><main><section><footer>.
- Fully responsive; plenty of whitespace; cards use rounded-2xl, light borders, soft hover.

ACCEPTANCE
- App builds and runs with Replit “Run”, showing a working preview URL.
- Orange brand applied; logo appears in navbar; no photos used.
- Services and Partnerships match EXACTLY as listed.
- Trust & Safety section shows the DTB policy and accounts.
- Buttons work: /quote link (OK if 404 for now), WhatsApp opens chat, phone link works on mobile.

After implementing, run the project and provide the live preview URL.
